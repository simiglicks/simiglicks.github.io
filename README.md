**About**

I am a first year MsC student at Weizmann Institute of Science. I am studying life scienes and currently doing a rotation in Dvir Gur's lab.
I have completed my bachelors in Biotechnology at Bar Ilan University, where I researched in Yigal Cohen's lab.
This website was created as an assignment for an Intro to Python course taught by G치bor Szab칩.


**Personal**

I made _aliya_ from America after I graduated high school. I like travelling, biking, and learning new things.
